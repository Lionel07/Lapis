# Design Document

This is a design document for the Lapis kernel written by Corwin McKnight (Lionel07)

## SECTION 1 "PURPOSE"

This is a hobbyist os designed to teach me high level and low level design, as well as be a nice topper for my Resume.

The goal is to write a fully functional kernel that can support a UNIX like userspace while being lightweight. This will mostly be used as a testing tool, or an OS for an Embedded system.

It will support multiple architectures, allowing a large variety of devices to run the code.
